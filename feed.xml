                <p>I now have a specific short term goal, which i’m using to help direct my TODO list. How to get to <em>Playtest 1</em>. What is the minimum set of features that need to be working so i can get a couple friends to check it out. </p><p>Some maybe interesting <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-building-block-player-account-341928">unity thing for user accounts/login?</a> </p><p>Added simple <code>isLocalPlayer</code> to the <strong>Entity</strong> class. This should be enough for the client-auth damage/hit-reaction stuff to move forward. </p><p>Oh yeah, got a really nice and simple <a href="https://github.com/ilhamhe/UnitySpriteFlash">sprite flash class</a>, which i think will be used for reactions but also HP related displays (yellow tinge, red tinge…)… so i do have to wire that all up, and maybe make an API, but that is a big item on the way to the first play-test, very excited.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1p6k1m6/how_we_got_10000_wishlists_in_a_little_over_a/">How to market your game</a>, pretty interesting, good advice. I’m not really interested in marketing the game… i’m not even sure about selling it yet. </p><p>Ok, got the hit reactions in using that new sprite flash thing, its sweet. Also added in local player auth for taking damage and dying. And respawning after 3 seconds! All working over the network. I really have to add some enemies or something, so i can test all this more easily!  I think on the TODO i just have the timing/value updates for the weapons, and since we are only going to have the one weapon for all players, that is pretty straightforward. </p><p>Spent some time re-timing the frame durations for the attacks and the cooldowns, as well as the hit-staggers. </p><pre><code>Idle: 20, 20, _loop
Jab: 8|jabBox, 5|hitOn, 10|hitOff, jabComplete|Idle
Slash: 12|slashBox, 10, 6|hitOn, 12|hitOff, slashComplete|Idle
</code></pre>
<p>Jab does 11 damage and a 12 frame hit-stagger. Slash does 17 damage, with an 18 frame hit-stagger. </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/files/2025-11-25_19-57.gif" alt="" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>

                <p>Ok, so i've been having fun getting the combat stuff in and working locally, now i have to get it working over the network, before i progress with any more updates. I just have to add the missing message handlers in the Server and Client, should be pretty easy.</p>
<p><em>LATER </em></p>
<p>Yep, updated the client/server stuff to push/receive the missing messages. Got all the actions moving over the network now. Still not sure about who/how/what is authoritative for, well, anything i guess... Especially as i start to get into stuff that is not all computed or required on the client... I think the next thing i'm working on is block-stagger for the attacker... Again, before i move things to the server, maybe i'm going to keep them client auth, and just move who is responsible for what around. So, getting hit an applying HP reduction will be client-auth on the client that got hit. Same for block-stagger... for now, just because the messages and complexity (in my head anyway) of getting all that onto the server is too much... </p>
<p>I am also going to have to refactor the whole "id" thing, as its tied to just the network connection. I need a more robust id system, so messages can be routed to any "entity" in a level. That is going to be a big-ish change, and require some new systems... </p>

                <p>Working on some basic "next steps" for the combat system. </p>
<ol>
<li>Action Lock and Rotation Lock while attacking</li>
<li>Attack Cooldowns</li>
<li>Mini-Stagger when hit (action lock, slowed movement)</li>
<li>HP &amp; Death</li>
</ol>
<p>When implementing the stagger stuff i had to revisit the frame animation system i wrote for this game (more details later). Specifically i had to add a <code>.durationMultiplier</code>, so i could simply extend the basic animations, and slow them down... Or i guess also speed them up. Anyway, that took a bit of futzing to get working corretly, now needing the frame accumulator to work with floats rather then the simple ints. Sigh. Stagger is kind of complicated because I also want any "in progress" actions (attacks, jump, roll, etc) to finish out before applying the stagger effects. </p>
<p>Finally added HP and damage values (very basic, <code>JabDamage</code> and <code>SlashDamage</code>just to get something in there quick). And the <strong>Death</strong> state/animation. Sweet. </p>

<p>I added some logic that checks when you are hit, if you are facing the entity that hit you, and if you are holding down the BLOCK input. If so, then you would have... blocked... the attack? Right now it just puts out a different debug log. But that is, now, a fully "functioning" combat system! Sorta. With no HP. Or reactions. </p>
<p>Oh, i also made the players/entities non-interactive, from the POV of their own colliders/physics, so you can now just pass-though another entity. Eventually there will be non-player entities which will block you, but for now, this is how i want it. </p>

<p><br>Ok, now have a `AttackHitboxController`, which is turning on/off the hit box and doing the `Physics.OverlapBox()` checks for other Entities. Had to revamp how i was flipping the visuals, so that not just the character-visuals game object was having its localScale.x * -1 for left, but also the combat game object, which will be dealing with hit boxes and hurt-boxes too (at some point). Anyway, these are now in a list of `Transforms` which need to be switched/flipped, if i ever have more... Turns out, box colliders do not like scale -1, so i actually now manually move the hit-box center when the player "flips" left to right. I added an event that things can subscribe to when that happens (in the Entity). <br><br>So, wow, i now have some simple "combat" like behaviour -- i really need to put in some kind of other damageable thing, so i can test without multiplayer... and maybe not look for a specific other ENTITY, but some `IDamageable` interface or something.</p>
<p>I should also note that this is local only, in that the local client is determining hits. Eventually, the server will be the source of truth for this kind of combat stuff, but i wanted to get something running quick, so i could see if the hit stuff was working. </p>
<p>This first gif shows the swing and hit, via a log in the console (very exciting).<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://dev.lofinet.org/media/posts/3/2025-11-19_21-41.gif" alt="" width="970" height="720"></figure>
<p>Ok and this second gif shows 2 clients (and the server) so you can see that they are actually networked. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://dev.lofinet.org/media/posts/3/2025-11-19_21-45.gif" alt="" width="970" height="720"></figure>

<ul>
<li>Online Multiplayer with a hosted Server</li>
<li>Persistant Voxel-ish 3D World</li>
<li>Top Down Isometric camera</li>
<li>2D sprite based characters</li>
<li>Not Minecraft, Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing
<ul>
<li>Although i hope to add <em>some</em> features from all those, eventually.</li>

<p>In order to be a bit different (haha, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/">18.5k games released last year on steam</a>) from many other online pixel/voxel games, I'm going to be intially concentrating on a skill based, lag-tolerant, press your luck PvP combat system. These will be 1 on 1 duels that players enter into by choice. </p>
<p>Here is a gif of some movement, running on a client connected to the server. </p>
