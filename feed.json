Pushing absolute hp values over the network to keep them updated, but am also applying damage locally, just that gets overridden by the authority, when the next update comes in. Seems to work well. Well enough. Hate HP bars. </p><p>Updated the INPUT MAP, to get all the controls setup on the controller, and on keyboard – probably still have some work to do on the keyboard mappings… WASD for movement… JKIL for Jab, Slash, Roll and Block? Leaving out WALK and CRAWL for now. </p><p>Thinking about <strong>ready</strong> vs. <strong>unready</strong>, and have come to <strong>equipped</strong> vs. <strong>un-equipped</strong>. If you put away your weapon, you get some movement speed bonus, but it takes like 1/4 second to equip before you can do combat actions. I kinda like it, except for yet <em>another</em> button. And the questions of auto-equip, if you tap an attack while un-equipped. Will have to test it, might be an option kinda thing. </p><p>Got the Roll and Block to have some cooldowns, and Block a minimum hold. Also Roll has “invulnerability” for the middle of it. Still really need to work on the whole “recovery” idea, at the end of actions, i dont have that working. </p><p>Doing some insane work on the <a href=\"https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/pixel-hero-maker-megapack-271664\">sprite package</a>, trying to rewrite the <code>CharacterBuilder</code>, to create new synthetic animation from collections of existing animation states/frames. I hadn’t realized that the Jab and Slash animations are “static”, with no leg movement. I really want them to have some, so i’m working on the code to <em>smoosh</em> those two animations together. No idea how its going to work. </p><p>… Works pretty good … Probably would not have attempted this if not for Cursor helping out. Have the state machine playing the static one if not moving, the moving one otherwise. Not perfect, but pretty good! </p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"./media/files/2025-11-26_21-39.gif\" alt=\"\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"./media/files/2025-11-26_21-48.gif\" alt=\"\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>",

I think on the TODO i just have the timing/value updates for the weapons, and since we are only going to have the one weapon for all players, that is pretty straightforward. </p><p>Spent some time re-timing the frame durations for the attacks and the cooldowns, as well as the hit-staggers. </p><pre><code>Idle: 20, 20, _loop\nJab: 8|jabBox, 5|hitOn, 10|hitOff, jabComplete|Idle\nSlash: 12|slashBox, 10, 6|hitOn, 12|hitOff, slashComplete|Idle\n</code></pre>\n<p>Jab does 11 damage and a 12 frame hit-stagger.

Got all the actions moving over the network now. Still not sure about who/how/what is authoritative for, well, anything i guess... Especially as i start to get into stuff that is not all computed or required on the client... I think the next thing i'm working on is block-stagger for the attacker... Again, before i move things to the server, maybe i'm going to keep them client auth, and just move who is responsible for what around. So, getting hit an applying HP reduction will be client-auth on the client that got hit. Same for block-stagger... for now, just because the messages and complexity (in my head anyway) of getting all that onto the server is too much... </p>\n<p>I am also going to have to refactor the whole \"id\" thing, as its tied to just the network connection. I need a more robust id system, so messages can be routed to any \"entity\" in a level. That is going to be a big-ish change, and require some new systems... </p>",

Anyway, that took a bit of futzing to get working corretly, now needing the frame accumulator to work with floats rather then the simple ints. Sigh. Stagger is kind of complicated because I also want any \"in progress\" actions (attacks, jump, roll, etc) to finish out before applying the stagger effects. </p>\n<p>Finally added HP and damage values (very basic, <code>JabDamage</code> and <code>SlashDamage</code>just to get something in there quick).
