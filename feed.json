That is now fixed, and the Block animation is now working. </p>\n<p><br>Ok, now have a `AttackHitboxController`, which is turning on/off the hit box and doing the `Physics.OverlapBox()` checks for other Entities. Had to revamp how i was flipping the visuals, so that not just the character-visuals game object was having its localScale.x * -1 for left, but also the combat game object, which will be dealing with hit boxes and hurt-boxes too (at some point). Anyway, these are now in a list of `Transforms` which need to be switched/flipped, if i ever have more... Turns out, box colliders do not like scale -1, so i actually now manually move the hit-box center when the player \"flips\" left to right. I added an event that things can subscribe to when that happens (in the Entity). <br><br>So, wow, i now have some simple \"combat\" like behaviour -- i really need to put in some kind of other damageable thing, so i can test without multiplayer... and maybe not look for a specific other ENTITY, but some `IDamageable` interface or something.</p>\n<p>I should also note that this is local only, in that the local client is determining hits. Eventually, the server will be the source of truth for this kind of combat stuff, but i wanted to get something running quick, so i could see if the hit stuff was working. </p>\n<p>This first gif shows the swing and hit, via a log in the console (very exciting).<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://hyakugei.github.io/LoFiNet-Blog/media/posts/3/2025-11-19_21-41.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"970\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>Ok and this second gif shows 2 clients (and the server) so you can see that they are actually networked. <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://hyakugei.github.io/LoFiNet-Blog/media/posts/3/2025-11-19_21-45.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"970\" height=\"720\"></figure>",
